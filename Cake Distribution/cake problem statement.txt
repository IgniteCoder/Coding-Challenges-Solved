A company is throwing party, each guest will have a cake with radius r based on their performance.
but, it would be unfair to give cake with differrent sizes to guests,
find the largest piece(radius of cake) that can be given to all guests,each guest gets only 1 piece, a piece cannot be cut into more pieces.

take PI= 3.14
area = PI * r * r

First line conatins number of guest n
Next line contains n spaced integers with radius ri

Sample Input:
5
1 2 3 5 6

Output: 2.5
